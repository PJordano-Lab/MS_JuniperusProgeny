Animal-dispersed seeds and maternal progenies distribution patterns across colonization gradients

![My_Image](Figure_1.png)

Seed dispersal interactions are key for the regeneration and expansion of the populations of many plant species. Frugivorous vertebrates generate varying seed and maternal progenies distributions, shaping the genetic structure and diversity of future forests. Here we connect the distribution of the maternal progenies in the seed rain across a plant expansion gradient to the contributing frugivores, establishing a new perspective in the study of dispersal mutualisms. We show that frugivores facilitate the dispersion of seeds from a diverse range of maternal plants, spreading new genotypes evenly across a plant expansion gradient, including the colonization edge. Frugivore foraging patterns (microhabitat preferences and foraging behaviors) strongly determine the maternal composition of the seed rain, generating maternal rich seed rains in preferred microhabitats. Our findings provide evidence that animal mediated seed dispersal can dilute founder effect processes and mitigate the expected erosion of genetic diversity during rapid population expansions.
